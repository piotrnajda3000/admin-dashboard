[Project brief](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

## Skills I've practiced in this project: 

- implementing a static website from a given design 
- Weback with dev-server, SCSS, and @mdi/fonts 
- grid used together with flexbox  
- Emmet 
- a bit of responsiveness achieved using grid w/ auto-fit columns and `fr` units, flex and relative responsive padding
- CSS & SCSS with mixins w/ arguments and variables for typography (with aid of Theme UI conventions), space, colors, and `rem` font sizes, which aid accesibility by respecting user's set browser font-size. 
- BEM 

**TODO:** 
- the website is usable only from around 900px upwards, since it's a desktop design without media queries
